# CorruptedImageScanner
This program automatically scans all the photos in the path you choose and lists all the incomplete and damaged images in it.
This program can be very useful in companies that deal with animation, rendering, and a huge amount of images because when we deal with a large amount of images, it is not possible to identify and list incomplete and damaged images manually.
