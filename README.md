# CorruptedImageScanner

This program scans all the images in the path you choose and displays the list of damaged and incomplete images in it.
It is a very efficient tool for companies that deal with image processing, rendering and large volumes of images. When dealing with a large number of images, manually finding one or more corrupted files among a large number of images is a time-consuming and error-prone task. This program will automatically do this job for you and lists the damaged images for you to review.
